# Texas Engineering World Health Hackathon Site

The central hub for the Texas Engineering World Health 2016 hackathon.
Accomplishes the following goals:

1. Allows teams to sign in
2. Teams can post ideas to a forum
3. There will be a "master feed" where all the different forum posts reside
4. Allows for announcements by "admin" users

Some of these design goals may be fluid, the README will be updated as they
change. This is reinventing the wheel without a doubt, but the hope is that
building this site from scratch will serve as a cool way to demonstrate that
TEWH is all about building things and that no previous expertise is
required to build something cool.

# Suggestions to Teammates

I don't know what the current tech stack is for this project, but I'd like to
recommend the following:

- `express.js` to serve the files (I am also open to using `flask` if you're
  feeling more python-y)

- `npm` to manage javascript packages, etc.
    - `babel` transpiler (I started writing ES6 javascript for work and it is a
      truly glorious thing. It will make our lives so much easier down the
      road).
